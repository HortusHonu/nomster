To stop having to restart the server after every change, make sure the following
is in the the config/environments/development.rb file
  # In the development environment your application's code is reloaded on
  # every request. This slows down response time but is perfect for development
  # since you don't have to restart the web server when you make code changes.
  config.cache_classes = false
  config.reload_classes_only_on_change = false
